# CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform image classification (or other tasks like object detection or segmentation) using Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The CNN architecture is designed to extract and learn spatial hierarchies in images through convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Project Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep learning models commonly used for analyzing visual data. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model on a dataset (such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, or a custom dataset). The model achieves state-of-the-art performance for the given task.

Key Features:
Preprocessing images and preparing the dataset.
Defining CNN layers and architecture.
Training the CNN using various optimization algorithms.
Evaluation of the model with accuracy, precision, and recall.
Saving the trained model for future use or deployment.

Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow keras matplotlib scikit-learn
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CNN-Project.git
cd CNN-Project
Usage
To train the CNN model, follow these steps:

Prepare the Dataset: Make sure your dataset is placed in the data/ folder. If you're using a dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10, it will be automatically downloaded using Keras.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train_cnn.py --dataset cifar10 --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
Evaluate the model:
bash
Copy code
python evaluate_cnn.py --model_path models/cnn_model.h5
Prediction: You can use the trained model to make predictions on new images:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --model_path models/cnn_model.h5
Command Line Arguments:
--dataset: The dataset to use (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or a custom dataset).
--epochs: Number of training epochs.
--batch_size: Batch size for training.
--model_path: Path to save or load the trained model.
--image_path: Path of the image to predict.
Dataset
This project supports the following datasets:

MNIST: Handwritten digit classification.
CIFAR-10: Image classification with 10 classes.
Custom Dataset: You can use your own dataset by placing it in the data/ folder and updating the data preprocessing steps.
Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: To extract features from input images.
Pooling Layers: To reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting during training.
Fully Connected Layers: To map the extracted features to the output classes.
Example Architecture:
Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
MaxPooling2D (2x2)
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
MaxPooling2D (2x2)
Fully Connected Layer (Dense, 128 units, ReLU activation)
Output Layer (Dense, softmax activation for classification)
You can modify the architecture by editing the cnn_model.py file.

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss (for classification tasks).

bash
Copy code
Epoch 1/10
Loss: 0.640
Accuracy: 85%
After training, the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.

Results
Training Accuracy: [insert percentage, e.g., 98%]
Test Accuracy: [insert percentage, e.g., 95%]
Confusion Matrix: [Optional: Show confusion matrix if it's a classification problem]
You can visualize the performance metrics using the matplotlib library.
